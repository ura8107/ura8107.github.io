I'm Yuki Matsuura, 2nd year Master's student at the University of Tokyo. My research focuses on International Relations and Comparative Politics within the range of political science.

Precisely, I study how nuclear weapons development technology (nuclear latency) leads to some international consequences, as my master's thesis project. I'm also working on what determines the likelihood of coups.
